# terraform azurerm issue #2819

A proof of concept to create Azure managed PostgreSQL read replicas until support can be implemented natively in the Azure provider.

For more details see the referenced issue: [PostgreSQL replica support #2819](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-azurerm/issues/2819).

If you're interested in just using the workaround, there's a module available on [Terraform Registery](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/booyaa/postgresql-read-replica/azurerm).
